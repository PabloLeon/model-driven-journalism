## Idea:
Questions drive exploration and analysis of data-analysis, but also journalistic pieces. I roughly distinguish between:
1. Questions that aim at a descriptive/factual response: "*What* was the spending on housing in 2016", "*How much* of the budget is allocated to education", "*Which* farmers get the most EU-subsidies".
2. Counterfactual or predictive questions: "What is the impact of Brexit on farmers"

Even the simplest of these questions are loaded and allow multiple interpretations, what is "the budget", what constitutes education, do we only consider direct subsidies or also indirect investments that benefit farming. Furthermore, even as non-experts we often have prior ideas and opinions about what parts of the answers constitute or even about basic characteristics of those. For instance leaving regulations might be interpreted as allowing for more policy leeway and as a result have a positive effect. These prior conceptions can at best be intuitive theories and implicit learning of characteristics (Griffiths, Tenenbaum Kemp movie ticket estimates paper), but also ill-informed urban myths, or psychological irrational behavior and beliefs (e.g. Linda bankteller, anchoring effect, confirmation bias) that might be perpetuated by information bubbles.

Exploring these prior assumptions offers great potential for understanding and correcting these erroneous beliefs, as well as charting the different perspectives of readers or humans in general. However, simply confronting people with facts might not necessarily be the right strategy to make them reconsider their prior assumptions and might sometimes even be counterproductive (that emotion paper). This can in part be explained by the fact that even the simplest questions and answers contain interpretation of entities, assumptions and relations, as well as the human preference to stick with ones convictions and social bounds instead of painfully reorganizing knowledge and reputation.

Here instead we try to make the reader engage with her own prior assumptions and biases and allow her to evaluate, articulate and express those. Finally, she can compare them to other users of the platform and thus position herself in her community.

## Process:
1. Generate high-level, guiding question or select one.
2. Express assumptions and expectations.
3. Generate model and fit.
4. Evaluate discrepancies between assumptions and model. Express opinion, story with text around assumptions and model.
5. Compare to other models, assumptions & texts.

## Example1 Comparisons: NHS waiting times

Simple comparative questions, like "How do NHS waiting times differ from my region to the rest of the country"? already spawn further questions. What do we mean by waiting times - time from first contact with the healthcare system until first assessment, or treatment, or recovery?
