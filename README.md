# Model-Driven Journalism Prototype

> " The importance of models may need to be underscored in this age of “big data” and “data mining”. Data, no matter how big, can only tell you what happened in the past. Unless you’re a historian, you actually care about the future — what will happen, what could happen, what would happen if you did this or that. Exploring these questions will always require models. Let’s get over “big data” — it’s time for “big modeling” (Bret Victor)

## Idea

This project attempts to implement an authoring tool for model-driven journalistic pieces. The central idea of the project is that sources should be explicit and conclusions transparent. This includes naming and linking (if possible) all data, as well as explicitly stating transformations, aggregations or filtering of data, as well as their argumentative role in the piece.

An article written in this form will constitute a journalistic text, that expresses the embedded sources and the argumentative structure. As a result it will exhibit characteristics of an scientific model - i.e. it will allow readers to modify assumtions and transformations of the piece and explore counterfactual scenarios. As such it will allow the interested reader to evaluate the sources and the validity of the conclusions, as well as derive own, alternative conclusions.

The final application will encourage these "what-if..." scenarios and the exchange between different authors and readers by allowing direct references, suggestions and criticisms of sources and conclusions. As such, the application expresses the central idea that only by explicitly stating our assumptions and conclusions we can make those critizisable, and via constructive criticism we can improve our understanding and inform the public.
